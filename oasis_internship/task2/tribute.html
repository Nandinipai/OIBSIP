                <p class="slidein">☛ Anne Frank was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1929.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ In 1934, when Anne was four-and-a-half, her family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands,
                    due to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam because of the German occupation
                    of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ In 1941, Anne lost her German citizenship and became stateless, even though she
                    spent most of her life in the Netherlands.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ Although Anne lived in the Netherlands and was considered a de facto Dutch
                    national, she never officially became a Dutch citizen.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ In July 1942, as persecutions of the Jewish population increased, the Frank family
                    went into hiding in concealed rooms behind a bookcase in Otto Frank's workplace.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ The hiding place is famously known as the "secret annex."</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ Anne regularly wrote in a diary she received as a birthday present in 1942 while in
                    hiding.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛ The family was arrested by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, bringing an end to their
                    time in hiding.

                <p class="early-life"><b>Life in Achterhuis</b></p>
                <p class="slidein">☛On July 6, 1942, the Frank family moved into hiding in the "Achterhuis" (Secret
                    Annex) above the Opekta offices in Amsterdam to escape persecution during World War II.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛The hiding place was concealed by leaving their home in disarray, creating the
                    impression of a sudden departure, and a note suggested they were going to Switzerland.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛The entrance to the Achterhuis was covered by a bookcase to remain undiscovered, and
                    only a few trusted employees, including Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep
                    Voskuijl, were aware of their presence.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛The helpers, risking their lives, provided news, support, and food to the occupants,
                    aware that sheltering Jews could result in the death penalty.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛In July 1942, the Van Pels family joined the Franks in hiding, and later, Fritz
                    Pfeffer, a dentist and family friend, also became a resident in the confined space.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Tensions arose among the inhabitants due to the cramped conditions, leading to
                    clashes and strained relationships, particularly with Fritz Pfeffer and the Van Pels family.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Anne Frank initially resented the intrusion of Fritz Pfeffer but later formed a
                    romantic connection with Peter Van Pels.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Anne documented her relationships with family members in her diary, expressing
                    closeness with her father and growing closer to her sister Margot during their confinement.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Anne's diary entries reveal her struggles with her mother and her eventual
                    realization of the misunderstandings that fueled their difficult relationship.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Despite the challenges of hiding, the Frank sisters continued their studies, with
                    Margot excelling in a correspondence course, and Anne devoted much of her time to reading, studying,
                    and documenting her thoughts and feelings in her diary.</p>

                <p class="early-life"><b>Arrest</b></p>
                <p class="slidein">☛On the morning of August 4, 1944, the Achterhuis, where Anne Frank and her family
                    were in hiding, was raided by German uniformed police led by SS-Oberscharführer Karl Silberbauer.
                </p>
                <p class="slidein">☛The Franks, Van Pelses, and Pfeffer were apprehended during the raid and taken to
                    the RSHA headquarters, where they underwent interrogation and were held overnight.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛On August 5, 1944, the captured individuals were transferred to the Huis van
                    Bewaring, an overcrowded prison on the Weteringschans.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Two days later, on August 7, 1944, they were transported to the Westerbork transit
                    camp, which had seen the passage of over 100,000 Jews, primarily Dutch and German.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Due to their arrest in hiding, the captured individuals were deemed criminals and
                    were subsequently sent to the Punishment Barracks within the Westerbork camp for hard labor.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛This series of events marked the end of the hiding period for Anne Frank and her
                    companions, leading to their subsequent imprisonment and the beginning of a tragic journey through
                    the Nazi transit and concentration camp system.</p>

                <p class="early-life"><b>Deportation and life in captivity</b></p>
                <p class="slidein">☛On September 3, 1944, Anne Frank and her family were deported from Westerbork to
                    Auschwitz. Bloeme Evers-Emden, a friend from Amsterdam, was on the same train.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Upon arrival at Auschwitz, men were separated from women and children. Otto Frank
                    was separated from his family, and those fit for labor were admitted while others, including 549
                    children under 15, were sent to gas chambers.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Anne Frank, having turned 15 three months earlier, was spared from immediate death.
                    She wasn't aware that the entire Achterhuis group had survived the initial selection.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Anne underwent the dehumanizing process at Auschwitz: forced to strip, had her head
                    shaved, and was tattooed with an identification number.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛During the day, the women, including Anne, were used as slave labor, while nights
                    were spent in overcrowded barracks. Anne displayed a mix of withdrawal and tears when witnessing
                    children being led to gas chambers, but also demonstrated strength and courage.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Disease spread rapidly, and Anne developed scabies. The sisters were moved to an
                    infirmary, where their mother, Edith Frank, stopped eating to save rations for her daughters.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛In October 1944, the Frank women were scheduled to join a transport to Liebau labor
                    camp, but Anne's scabies prevented her. Bloeme Evers-Emden went without them.</p>
                <p class="slidein">☛Selections for relocation to Bergen-Belsen began in October 1944. Over 8,000 women,
                    including Anne and Margot, were transported. Edith Frank remained and died of disease, starvation,
                    and exhaustion. Anne briefly reunited with friends Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz in
                    Bergen-Belsen, sharing her hope to write a book based on her diary after the war. Anne expressed
                    belief in her parents' death and a desire not to live any longer. These interactions occurred in
                    late January or early February 1945, and both friends survived the war.</p>
